			<p>If you have an iPhone, or even if you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ve likely heard the plight of
iOS users who are unable to change the default application for handling a
certain kind of content.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-ios-defaults-firefox.png" alt="Firefox documentation lamenting the lack of changeable defaults" /></p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s defaults system is kind of broken. In particular, it&rsquo;s missing any kind
of disambiguation. That means that every app has to have a unique url scheme
that it uses, and it alone. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a requirement, but it seems
like apps are misusing the &ldquo;authority&rdquo; part of a URI as part of the path. For
example, Twitter uses the <code>twitter</code> scheme for handling inter-app links on iOS:</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-ios-defaults-twitter.png" alt="Twitter has issues with authority" /></p>

<p>It feels so distinctly un-Apple to have made things work this way. The way
Android handles the situation is much more correct, and makes a difference
between host and path. Of course, Android includes UI to allow users to select
which app should handle a URL if multiple apps are able to.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-ios-defaults-android.png" alt="Android's URL matching is more complete" /></p>

<p>Apple&rsquo;s own documentation has fun using URL and URI interchangeably, which is
kind of annoying since people should take the time to make documentation as
correct as possible. URL in particular is for resources over a network, and apps
on the same phone are definitely not over the network.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-ios-defaults-docs.png" alt="Apple also has issues with authority" /></p>

<p>Apple has certainly heard people complain that they can&rsquo;t change app defaults at
all on iOS. I&rsquo;m sure they have their own internal reasoning as to why they
haven&rsquo;t done it yet. Their documentation talks about there being no process
&ldquo;yet&rdquo; to determine which app actually gets a scheme that it registers if that
scheme conflicts with another app, which means that they at least recognize that
in theory it&rsquo;s something they could fix. My best guess is that their reasoning
is that a feature that allows easily changing default apps would lower
engagement for their own and others&rsquo; apps. I think it&rsquo;s pretty cynical to think
along those lines, but it&rsquo;s tough to justify if not for that reason.</p>

<p><img src="/img/apple-ios-defaults-disambiguation.png" alt="Apple uses the magic word" /></p>

<p>The biggest question is whether changing defaults would actually make the iPhone
better over time. The issue is that it likely wouldn&rsquo;t. The iPhone is more than
just a hardware platform, it&rsquo;s an entire ecosystem of services. You can use
other apps on the iPhone: the integration point is the homescreen. If you
remember, the very first iPhone didn&rsquo;t have third-party apps at all. The amount
of work that it probably took to overhaul everything to allow for third party
apps was no doubt huge. Third party apps, in a general sense, grow the
usefulness of the iPhone, especially in the long run.</p>
