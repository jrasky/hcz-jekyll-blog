In the book _Impro_, Keith Johnstone discusses how he views the world of
narrative, and especially how he considers the formation of a narrative. In his
view, a narrative is really much more about structure than content. Structure is
the most important thing, after which the content just sort of adapts to
whatever the situation is. In particular, he explores how narratives are really
about breaking routine. Somebody might be on the routine of walking home, when
they are whisked away to some magical world, breaking their routine. Over the
course of the story, more routines are formed and then broken, adding more and
more layers to the narrative.

Some of the reviews of Johnstone's novel emphasize how _Impro_ isn't "just a
book about improvisation," but a book that drives at some more fundamental
issues and questions in the human psyche and experience. I know that this book
is really a pop psychology piece, like so many others, but it's tough to really
deny the appeal of a work of this nature. I think more broadly, the reason that
people feel this way is that theater is in a way a reflection of our daily
lives. In particular, improvising is something that we all have to do on a daily
basis when dealing with other people. What that means is that the problems that
surface when trying to improvise effectively have a lot in comomn with the
problems that people have when trying to socialize.

Narratives are a powerful way to interpret the world. It's easy to see human
activity as centering around the routines that people have. The most important
episodes in life are then when those routines are broken, and when new ones take
their place. This is true in many aspects of life, not just in the physical
routines that people have. There is evidence to show (TODO find this) that
people like to "try on" various belief systems. These beliefs are kind of like
mental and emotional routines, thought patterns that people go through as a way
to parse and deal with the world around them. The same thinking around breaking
routines then also applies here, except that the routines are of a different
kind. People are sometimes forced to break their mental routines, and fit
themselves into something new.

People form their life stories when they break routines. As they do, they find
new routines, and in time break those, adding more layers to their life stories.
I've gone through this process many times myself, shifting both in physical and
mental routines, breaking and forming new ones in the ongoing story of my life.

The people around me go through similar experiences, forming and then breaking
similar routines. Watching people go through this a great reflection on my own
progress as a person. I recognize those similar routines that people have, and
which they then go on to break in similar ways to the ways that I did back when
I went through what they were going through.

One of the more interesting routines that I had and then broke ended with me
realizing the importance of usability. The younger people around me sometimes
have the routine of deeply customizing their user interfaces, either in looks or
in functionality. Other times they have the routine of liking user interfaces
that are purely text-driven, or have some basis in the "unix philosophy." I know
that I liked these sorts of things when I was younger, as did a lot of the
communities that I frequented when I was younger.

One [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13009461) I read a while back
about this made a point about how Apple was (or at least, used to be) great
because it was a company with Opinions. These capital-O Opinions, over
lower-case o opinions, mean that Apple had certain ideas about they wanted you
to use their products, and they got upset if you ventured too far outside that.
In return, they made sure that everything worked very well within that set of
Opinions. The end-result of this was that everything "just worked," because
everything was predicated on the same set of Opinions.

In contrast, a lot of the interfaces that younger people around me sometimes
like lack these kinds of capital-O Opinions. Instead, they have weaker
opinions, which they don't really enforce so much as suggest. In many instances
this is for the better, because the opinions that they do have do not work very
well to improve usability. Rather than choosing the products and tools that
provide the best experience out of the box, some of the people around me choose
tools and platforms that can be reshaped into whatever user interface they find
most appealing.

I think that a big part of consumer technology, versus enterprise or developer
technology, is that of Opinions over opinions. More niche use cases, like
enterprise deployments, might have their own set of Opinions, and whatever
software they used need to be able to bend to their own needs. However, most
consumers don't have the knowledge, ability, or time to create these kinds of
Opinions. Instead, the products developed for them are created with those
Opinions in mind. These Opinions have behind them thinking and refinement from
thousands of expert hours, in every way. What this means is that all they have
to do is adapt to have those same Opinions, and they too can benefit from all
that work.

Narratives and frameworks form a very important basis of how people view the
world. Many studies corroborate the fact that users--and people, in
general--tend to rely on previous knowledge to guide their learning in a new
area. This means that being exposed to a certain set of Opinions as a consumer
leads people to then examine and consider other products that they come across
in terms of that framework, and those sets of assumptions. I imagine this is the
basis for all the fanboy-ing that I see online, and the basis for all the
arguments along various technological lines by people who really don't have a
good basis of knowledge in those subject matters.

Most striking for me has been the very material change in the way that I think
about Microsoft and its products. I have recently been picking up Windows
Internals, which dives into deep details of the design of Windows at a system
level. One of the memes that I've heard many times about Windows is that it's a
badly designed, poorly implemented system. I regret to say that I've come to be
of the opposite opinion, because a lot of the things that Microsoft has done are
extremely interesting. I remember once reading that the reason that Windows did
so well was mainly a case of "right place, right time," over any real technical
differences. One of the lessons that I feel like I've learned over time is that
business decisions--and generally, most decisions--often have a basis in both.
Something has to not only be the best technical decision, but also the best
political, or the most profitable, before it really becomes the best decision
overall.

This kind of thinking is something that I always feel is lacking in the tech
community. One conversation that I've had pretty recently was about how
engineers routinely get paid a whole lot less than managers. This sentiment is
one that I feel like I've heard many times before, and it's usually predicated
on some sort of "managers don't really know anything" kind of thinking. If you
talk to really any startup that's had much success, a lot of them will tell you
about how they started out being organizationally flat, but then went away from
that model. What I imagine they've found--which is something that I think I've
found--is that a good manager is crucial to having a good team. Good managers
make sure that the problems happening outside the team don't creep in to
distract and undermine the team's efforts in general. The worst managers are
probably those that don't do a good job of that. These managers leave their
teams in disarray, constantly feeling the pull from external sources in too many
ways.

Dealing with people is something that is really very difficult. I think a lot of
the people who are of the "managers don't know anything" club would probably
agree on that front, which is why I always find it interesting when they try to
make that argument. I completely understand their frustration if they have a bad
manager, or if they have a good manager who keeps them from doing something they
think is a good idea but would really only be self-destructive. I guess all I'm
saying is that I'm surprised that some people lack the emotional capacity to
separate their own personal opinions of someone and their opinions of a
profession in general.

The manager discussion hits on a lot of the same points that I feel like other
discussion of consumer software, and Apple, and so many other things do. The
main point is: usability is king. It doesn't matter what the specific technical
merits of some solution are, all that matters is that it results in the thing
that's most usable. For managers, the best solution is the one that's the most
usable from the point of view of the team. From the point of view of business
decisions, the best area to place focus is the one that results in the most
usable gains in whatever area. (maybe rephrase or rethink this point a little
bit). For software, the best choices are the ones that result in the most usable
piece of software by the most users.

Usability is king for the simple reason that humans make tools to amplify their
own abilities. Humans look for ways to make their lives easier, and especially
for the tools that can act as leverage for their own abilities. Find a big
stick, and you can focus less on strength and more on exactly how you want to
move something. The same can be said for software tools. The best software is
the one that takes something that's boring, or annoying, or error-prone, and
instead lets you focus on what's more important. A good calendar application
makes you focus less on making sure you keep events tidy, and more on just
creating and managing them. A good text editor lets you focus less on
formatting, and more on just writing the text.

These kinds of usability considerations underly many of the reasons why people
pick software, people, places, or really any number of other things.
