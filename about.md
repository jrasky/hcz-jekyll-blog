I'm Jerome Rasky, a software engineer from California currently pursuing a
Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver,
Canada.

Through my work as an intern in a number of positions, as well as my general
experience in a wide-ranging set of skills in computer science, I have the
experience to take on almost any challenge.

Interesting challenges are really what I strive for, especially in my personal
projects. When I started my operating system kernel as a side-project, I had
very little idea how many functions of an operating system actually came
together. It took a lot of searching and learning to be able to accomplish the
ideas that I had built up in my mind.

Beyond just computer science, I'm always searching for the next challenge to
take on. I am currently the Vice Presidence External of the UBC Computer Science
Student Society, charged with the annual Technical Career Fair. Managing this
event has challenged my time management and communication skills like never
before. Taking responsibility for people and deadlines is something that I
wasn't very used to before, but something that I'm quickly learning to do
effectively.

On the side, I also like to have some fun. Life isn't complete without good
friends and good food, both of which are things I strive for daily. I'm excited
for things to come, and for where my life will bring me in the next few years.
