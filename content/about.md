I'm Jerome Rasky, a software engineer located in Seattle, Washington. I'm
currently working at AWS, specifically on AWS IoT SiteWise. I've been involved
many levels of engineering, from operations and infrastructure, to backend
service design, to frontend web design. I love working on tough projects, and
finding simple solutions to complex problems.
